# EveryMatrix workshops
In this repo, we intend to keep a list of ideas, debates, workshops, presentations, etc. 
If you're submitting something, it doesn't mean that you will present it - you can do that 
and it's encouraged, but is not a must; anyone can comment and say that he wants talk about
that specific subject.

Don't be afraid to submit an issue, even if it sounds stupid, something interesting may come up in the talk.

### To Submit a talk or Suggest a topic:

1. Go to the [Issues](https://github.com/EveryMatrix/workshops/issues) page for this repository
2. Create a new "Issue" (e.g. Meeting Topic)
3. Set the title to **"[COOL_TALK_TITLE_GOES_HERE]"**, followed by your name(if you are volunteering to speak on the topic)
4. Add a description(if needed) that can help others figure out what you want
5. Add correct tags to the issue (don't be afraid, if you don't know what labels to use 
someone will/can add them for you)
